3. While at an elegant dinner party, Dr. Moriarty has laced one of n glasses of wine
with a deadly poison. Mr. Holmes is also a guest, and wishes to warn the intended
victim as quickly as possible. Luckily, there is a chemical test for the poison that is
extremely sensitive and can be applied to combined samples. Thus, Mr. Holmes can
present a combined sample from any subset of wine glasses to the test, and the test
will accurately tell him whether the combined sample contains any amount of poison.

3A) Give a procedure to accomplish this that will use O(log n) tests.
notes: this is like a binary search. It could be the nth glass of wine and we cut it in half then search 

findPoison(int[] arr, int x) //x is the poison

int size = sizeof(arr);
if(size > 1){

int middle = n/2
if(arr[middle] == x){
   return middle;
}
int[] bottom = [1,...,middle]
int[] top = [middle+1,...,n]

if(poison = in bottom){
  return findPoison(bottom, x);
}else{
  return findPoison(top, x);
} 
           
}

3B) Show that no matter what procedure Holmes uses, â„¦(log n) tests may be necessary. Since the host is a computer scientist, you may assume that n = 2k

if n = 1, we directly return 1. 
No matter what, we go through the array. The algorithm will always be at least log n because the list gets smaller. even if the algorithm cuts the array in half once, it still gets smaller before finding the answer if it is the middle.
