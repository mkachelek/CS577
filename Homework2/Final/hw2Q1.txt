Question 1 

Ix = illegitimate = â…“ of legitimate 
Lx = legit for x = 1,...,n 

We have an inheritance: var inheritance 
method for Ix: illegitimate 
method for Lx: legitimate 

n children: could be an array 
x: number of children that are illegitimate '

in an array of n children, x are illegit 
we want to compute: 
    Ix, the share to each x and 
    Lx, the share to each n - x 
    
Thine algorithm <3

1A)  Suppose there are n children, of whom x are illegitimate. Design an algorithm
that allows you to compute Ix, the share due each illegitimate child, and Lx, the
share due each legitimate child, for x = 1, . . . , n.

public class Question1 {

  public static void calcInheritance(int n, int x) { // we have n children, x are illegitimate

    int numOfI = x; // illegitimate children
    int numOfL = n - x; // legitimate children
    double Ix = 0.0; // amount each gets
    double Lx = 0.0;

    // calc what it would be, divided equally
    double ifEqual = (double) 1 / n;

    if (n == x) {
      Ix = (ifEqual) / 3;
      Lx = 0;
    }

    Ix = ifEqual / 3; // how much each illegit gets

    // now calc legit
    Lx = (1 - (Ix * numOfI)) / numOfL; // we do total - (num each gets * each person) divided by
                                       // number of legit people that gets some

    System.out.println(Lx);
    System.out.println(Ix);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Question1.calcInheritance(7, 4);

  }
}


1B) As a function of n, how many operations are used by your algorithm? A big-O
result is sufficient

This is constant because there are no loops, it does simple math. This is O(1).

1C) Use your procedure to determine the shares when n = 7 and x = 4

if equal = 1/7
Ix = (1/3)(1/7) 
   = 1/21
Lx = (1/21)*4 = 4/21
   = 1-(4/21) =17/21
   = (17/21) / 3 
   = 17/63
 
Each legitimate child will get 17/63 (~27%) and each illegitimate child will get 1/21 (~5%) 
check: 4(1/21)+ 3(17/63) = 1 
 
1D) Naive algorithm design can have unintended effects. Discuss what happens when x = n
I will try to do that here
n = 4, x = 4 

when x = n that means that all the children are illegitimate. I decided that if they are all illigitimate, they will split it equally then take 1/3 of that. 
So, using n and x as 4, the share would be 0.08333333333333333.
